      <p>Notetaking is very important for learning and retaining knowledge in a course.
        Many times there are students who were unable to make it to a class, or students with disabilities unable to take the notes themselves.
        Sharing notes can be a beneficial way to overcome both these problems.</p>

      <p>Knotes is a online service that allows users to upload their class notes and convert them into a compilation of texts and images.
        On the Knotes websites, users can view other notes uploaded by their fellow classmates and show their support with a like, allowing the user who liked the note to save it for later,
        and the note itself being prioritized for other classmates browsing the course.</p>
